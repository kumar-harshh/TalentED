## Getting Started

**Recommendations**
- Use a virtual environment in order to avoid "library-pollution" in your system. It's just few commands:
  - Navigate to your project directory & based on your system(Windows/Mac) Use the command
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  ```
- Keep all your secret in .env file-Shhhhhh! No One Should Know your API Keys
- Use .gitignore with standard python template-It's Just a google search away


1. **Installation:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit google.generativeai PyPDF2 python-dotenv streamlit-lottie
    ```

2. **API Configuration:**
    - Obtain a Google API key and store it in a `.env` file as `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key`.
    - If not created already, Get your API Key here: (https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
  
3. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run your_app_filename.py
    ```
    Replace `your_app_filename.py` with the name of your Python script containing the provided code.

4. **Usage:**
    - Enter the job role and paste the job description.
    - Upload your resume in PDF format.
    - Click the "Submit" button to initiate the evaluation process.
